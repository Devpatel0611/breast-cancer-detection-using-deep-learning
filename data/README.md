# Dataset Information

This project uses a publicly available medical imaging dataset for breast cancer detection.

## Dataset Source
**Ultrasound Breast Images for Breast Cancer Detection**  
Available on Kaggle:  
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vuppalaadithyasairam/ultrasound-breast-images-for-breast-cancer/data

## Dataset Description
The dataset contains ultrasound images of breast tissue categorized into:
- **Benign**
- **Malignant**

These images are used to train and evaluate a deep learning model for automated breast cancer classification.

## Data Usage
Due to size and licensing constraints, the dataset is **not included** in this repository.

To reproduce the results:
1. Download the dataset from the link above
2. Extract it

## Ethical Considerations
- The dataset is publicly available and anonymized
- No personal or sensitive patient information is included
- This project is intended **strictly for educational and research purposes**

## Notes
- Ensure consistent image preprocessing before training
- Dataset imbalance should be handled during training (e.g. class weighting or augmentation)
